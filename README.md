# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

## This repository contains 3 files:
* The current README.MD file.
* An r script (run_analysis.R) that can be used to clean and rearrange data provided in the original set to produce a tidy data set of summary information.
* A codebook (CodeBook.md) that describes the different variables in the resulting tidy data set.

Interested readers are encouraged to first download and unzip the original data file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Once this is complete, use the run_analysis.R script to process the raw data and convert it to a tidy data set.

For details on the resulting file please consult the CodeBook.md file.
